Importance of Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Well-engineered features can:

Capture Relevant Information: By creating features that embody domain knowledge, you can help the model focus on the most crucial aspects of the data.

Enhance Model Performance: High-quality features can significantly improve the predictive power of your models, resulting in better accuracy and generalization.

Handle Missing Data: Feature engineering techniques can assist in managing missing data, preventing models from making biased or inaccurate predictions.

Mitigate Overfitting: Thoughtfully engineered features can help mitigate overfitting by providing the model with more relevant information.

Data Preparation Steps
Data preparation involves several key steps, each contributing to the process of refining the data for analysis and modeling:
